What happens in 'docker container run'

Taking the below as sample command.
docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webhost1 nginx

1. Looks for the image locally in the image cache, doesn't find anything.
2. Then looks in remote image repository (defaults to docker hub)
3. Download the latest version (nginx:latest by default). Noted nginx based on the example.
4. Creates a new container based on that image and prepares to start.
5. Gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine.
6. Opens port 80 on host and forwards to port 80 in container. This will happen if we specify any port related details in the command.
7. Starts container by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile.

Example of changing defaults.. Sample command below.

docker container run --publish 8080:80 --name webhost -d nginx:1:11 nginx -T
